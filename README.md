Lichen is configured to handle 256 color terminals. 
Many of the colorschemes that can be found online are actually designed
  for gViM, which is the GUI implementation of ViM.
Lichen will provide a similar syntax highlighting experience as gViM
  but inside your terminal.
It also has most of the relevant keywords for configuring any new/old 
  colorscheme.
So even if you don't like it, it can serve as a template for a new
  terminal colorscheme.


Lichen was modified from a colorscheme called moss, which partially 
  worked in the terminal.
Lichen provides a dark colorscheme with blues, greens, and browns
  designed to minimize distraction and eyestrain from brightness
  while maximizing utility by providing quick distinct color shorthands.


Lichen has been used with nearly every programming language/format 
  including TeX (LaTeX), Python, Fortran, Fortran 90, C, C++, vimscript, 
  PERL, bash, csh, yaml, json, html, xml, md (markdown), MATLAB, 
  sed, and even binary.
The vimrc found in http://github.com/hellabyte/myconfig is recommend to
  get syntax highlighting working for all the above filetypes (i.e. 
  for Fortran 90 the Hellabyte vimrc will correctly provide free-format
  syntax highlighting).
